# What is PHPLucidFrame?

PHPLucidFrame (a.k.a. LucidFrame) is an application development framework for PHP developers. It provides logical structure and several helper utilities for web application development. It uses a functional architecture to simplify complex application development. It is especially designed for PHP, MySQL and Apache. It is simple, fast, lightweight and easy to install.

Almost zero configuration - just configure your database setting and you are ready to go. No complex JSON, XML, YAML or vHost configuration.

No template engine to eliminate overhead of template processing and to save your storage from template cache files.

It supports a wide range of web application development features:

- Database access API
- Security control
- URL routing
- Validation helpers
- Internationalization & Localization
- User authentication & authorization API
- Schema Manager
- Database Seeding
- Query Builder
- Shell & Console Tool
- Ajax

## Prerequisites

- Web Server (Apache with `mod_rewrite` enabled)
- PHP version 5.6 or newer is recommended, but we strongly advise you to use one of the currently supported versions.
- MySQL 5.0 or newer

## Installation

- Extract [the downloaded archive](http://www.phplucidframe.com/download/release/latest) in your local webserver document root, and you will get a folder named **phplucidframe-x.y.z** where **x.y.z** would be your downloaded version.
- Rename it as **phplucidframe**.
- Open your terminal or command line and CD to your project root, and then run `php lucidframe secret:generate`. For more about the PHPLucidFrame console, read [the documentation section "The LucidFrame Console"](http://www.phplucidframe.com/download/doc/latest).
- Check `http://localhost/phplucidframe` in your browser.

**Note:**
- If you have your own project folder name other than `phplucidframe` in your development environment, you have to change the value of `baseURL` in `/inc/parameter/development.php` in accordance with your project name.
- If you use a virtual host for your project, you have to leave an empty string for the value of `baseURL` in `/inc/parameter/development.php`.

## Alternate Installation with Composer

You can install PHPLucidFrame alternatively using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org). Open your terminal and CD to your webserver document root, and then run

    composer create-project --prefer-dist phplucidframe/phplucidframe [your-project-name]

**Note:** You have to change the value of baseURL in `/inc/parameter/development.php` according to `[your-project-name]`.

## Furthermore on Installation

**Based URL** : There are two situations you will have to leave the configuration `baseURL` empty in `/inc/parameter/xxx.php` files:

1. when you have a virtual host for your application in your development environment.
2. when your application in production environment where you upload the framework files directly to your web server document root.

**Routing** : You can define custom routes in `/inc/route.config.php`. The following routing for home page maps to `/app/home/index.php`.

    route('lc_home')->map('/', '/home');

PHPLucidFrame encourages a structured page organization. You can check the recommended structure in the sample page folders and codes `/app/home/` and `/app/example/` of the release.

**Additional Site Settings** : You can also configure the other settings in `/inc/config.php` and `/app/inc/site.config.php` according to your requirement.

**CSS Template** : PHPLucidFrame provides you a default site CSS template `/assets/css/base.css`. To make your site easily upgradable in the future, create your own file in `/app/assets/css` with whatever name you like and update your `/app/inc/tpl/layout.php` by including `<?php _css('yourfilename.css'); ?>`. Then you can override the rules of `/assets/css/base.css` in your CSS file.
