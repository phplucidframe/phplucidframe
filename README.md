PHPLucidFrame (a.k.a LucidFrame) is a mini application development framework - a toolkit for PHP developers. It provides logical structure and several helper utilities for web application development.
It uses a functional architecture to simplify complex application development. LucidFrame is especially designed for PHP, MySQL and Apache. It is simple, fast, lightweight and easy to install.

Almost zero configuration - just configure your database setting and you are ready to go. No complex JSON, XML, YAML or vHost configuration.

No template engine to eliminate overhead of template processing and to save your storage from template cache files.

Although it is stated as mini framework, it supports a wide range of web application development features:

- Datatase access API
- Security control
- URL routing
- Validation helpers
- Internationalization & Localization
- User authentication & authorization API
- Ajax

## Prerequisites

- Web Server (Apache with `mod_rewrite` enabled)
- PHP version 5.2.0 or newer (optional `mcrypt` extension enabled, but recommended)
- MySQL 5.0 or newer with MySQLi enabled.

## Installation

- Extract [the downloaded archive](https://github.com/cithukyaw/LucidFrame/releases/latest) in your local webserver document root, and you will get a folder named **LucidFrame-x.y.z** where **x.y.z** would be your downloaded version.
- Rename it as **LucidFrame** or your project name.
- Copy `/inc/config.default.php` and rename it to `/inc/config.php`
- Copy `/inc/site.config.default.php` and rename it to `/inc/site.config.php`.
- Check `http://localhost/LucidFrame` or `http://localhost/YourProjectName` in your browser.

**Note:** If you have your own project folder name other than **LucidFrame**, you should change `$lc_baseURL` in `/inc/config.php` in accordance with your project name.

## Using Composer

You can also install LucidFrame using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/).

    composer require lucidframe/phplucidframe:~1.2.0

OR

	php composer.phar require lucidframe/phplucidframe:~1.2.0

## Furthermore on Installation

Make sure you have `mod_rewrite` activated on your server / in your environment.
Some guidelines:

- [XAMPP for Windows](http://www.leonardaustin.com/blog/technical/enable-mod_rewrite-in-xampp/)
- [Ubuntu 14.04 LTS](http://www.dev-metal.com/enable-mod_rewrite-ubuntu-14-04-lts/)
- [Ubuntu 12.04 LTS](http://www.dev-metal.com/enable-mod_rewrite-ubuntu-12-04-lts/)
- [EasyPHP on Windows](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8158770/easyphp-and-htaccess)
- [AMPPS on Windows/Mac OS](http://www.softaculous.com/board/index.php?tid=3634&title=AMPPS_rewrite_enable/disable_option%3F_please%3F)
- [MAMP on Mac OS](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7670561/how-to-get-htaccess-to-work-on-mamp)

You could have a folder whatever name you like or even virtual host in your development environment.
Just change the configuration variable `$lc_baseURL` in `/inc/config.php` in accordance with your folder name or virtual host name.

In your production environment, you may not have a folder and you could upload the framework files directly to your web server document root.
In this case, you have to set and leave `$lc_baseURL` empty.

By default, LucidFrame has home page routing which is defined as `$lc_homeRouting` in `/inc/config.php`. It maps to `/app/home/index.php`. You could have `home.php` or `welcome.php` or whatever you like. However, LucidFrame encourages a structured page organization. You can check the sample page folders and codes in the application folder`/app` of the release.

You can also configure the other settings in `/inc/config.php` and `/inc/site.config.php` according to your requirement.

You can generate the application secret `/inc/.secret` at [phplucidframe.sithukyaw.com/hash-generator](http://phplucidframe.sithukyaw.com/hash-generator).
